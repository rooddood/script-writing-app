# Your Web Application

This project appears to be a web application built using Vite and potentially React or another modern JavaScript framework.

## Getting Started (Local Development)

Follow these instructions to run the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (version 16 or higher is recommended) should be installed on your system. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
* **npm** (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js.

### Running the Application

1.  **Clone the Repository:** If you haven't already, clone this project repository to your local machine using Git.

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the cloned project.

3.  **Install Dependencies:** Install all the necessary packages by running the following command:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command reads the `package.json` file and downloads all the listed dependencies from npm.

4.  **Start the Development Server:** Run the following command to start the local development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command executes the `dev` script defined in your `package.json` file, which is typically configured to start the Vite development server.

5.  **Open in Your Browser:** Once the development server starts successfully, it will usually provide a local URL where you can view the application in your web browser. This is often `http://localhost:5173/` or a similar address. Check your terminal output for the exact URL.

### Building for Production (Optional)

To create an optimized build of your application for deployment:

1.  Run the build command:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command will generate a production-ready build of your application in a `dist` folder.

2.  **Preview Production Build (Optional):** You can preview the production build locally using the `start` script (if defined in `package.json`):
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    Alternatively, you can use a static file server to serve the contents of the `dist` folder.

## Technologies Used (Based on File List)

* **Vite:** For development server and building.
* **React (Likely) or other modern JavaScript framework.**
* **TypeScript:** As the programming language.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For styling.
* **Drizzle ORM:** For database interactions.
