EXT. PARK - DAY

A boy and a girl stand in the middle of a park arguing loudly. The camera pans from the trees to the boy who points to the sky and says, "It's obviously going to rain. Look at those clouds!" The camera shifts to the girl who shakes her head and replies, "No, it's not. Those clouds are just passing by." The camera zooms in on the boy crossing his arms and says, "You're always so stubborn. Why can't you just admit I'm right?" The camera cuts to the girl glaring at him and says, "Because you're not right. It's sunny, and it will stay sunny." The camera follows the boy as he throws his hands up in frustration and says, "Fine! Let's just wait and see." The camera focuses on the girl smirking and says, "Fine. But when it doesn't rain, you owe me an apology." The camera slowly zooms out showing the park as the argument fades into the background.
